For this lab you will demonstrate your knowledge of github practices as well as establish the norms and processeses for your team. You assignment is the following.

## Part 1
1. Clone this repo to your local
2. Create a branch titled `feature/firstname_lastname`
3. Add a new unique endpoint that returns your name and a brief description of yourself. 
4. Commit your changes to your new branch and push them up to your remote branch on github. 
5. Open a Pull Request against the master branch in your repo.
6. Perform a code review with your other team members.
7. Merge your changes to master and close your branch.

By the end of this exercise you should have a new endpoint for every member of your team on the master branch. 

## Part 2 

Together with your team you will plan out how you will work together as a team. You will come up with two items: a description of your Team Norms and a description of your Code Review process for your team. Your team norms are the rules for your team and expectations for how every member of the team will contribute to the team. These rules can be things such as "work will be distributed evenly" or "disagreements will be decided by a fair vote" or any other standards you want to set for the team to make working life easier. The Code Review process is how your team will perform code reviews to make sure that your code is consistent and no bugs are introduced. This is a good time to look at style guides for python and agree on one for your team. 

By the end of this exercise you should have a the team norms document filled in with at least five rules for each section. Ideally you would have more than five, but five is a good start for now. We will refer back to these if there is trouble in your team so make sure you all agree and that you adequately define the roles and responsibilities for your team.
